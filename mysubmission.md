## Abstract 

<p>This article critiques 3 digital storytelling methods-- interactive slideshows, vidos/infographics, and written article-- through an analysis of media surrounding the Menendez Brothers case. It examines how each format's design, tone, and accessibility shape audience engagement and ethical responsibiity when representing trauma and crime. By comparing how these digital methods balance emotion, information, and integrity, the piece reveals the creative and moral challenges inherent in digital media production. Aligned with the <i>CTRL+ALT+DH</i> theme <b>"Digital Dilemmas"</b>, this work explores how techmology comlicates storytelling by blurring the line between creative innovation and ethical accountabiliity in the representation of real human experiences.</p>

<hr> 


<p>On the evening of August 20th, 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez shot their parents <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menendez-brothers-inside-the-notorious-case-48-hours/" target="_blank">[1]</a>, Jose and Kitty Mendez (Fig. 1.1), and killed them in their own home in Beverly Hills, California. After burying their shotguns, they visited their local movie theater to see the latest Batman movie, creating an alibi. Upon returning to their home, Lyle called 911 and claimed, “Somebody killed my parents!”. Questioning the children of the victims is hardly a first thought, especially if they were the ones who made the call. Initially, the police suspected that the murders were mafia-related, as Jose was a significant businessman with ties. At this point, Lyle and Erik had pulled off a smooth and successful murder.

<p>What makes this case of domestic homicide especially intriguing is that eventually, both murderers openly admitted to their crimes. But why? After a month-long testimony, the brothers intensely described the years of sexual abuse they endured from their parents. When the brothers stood up and threatened to expose what was happening to them, Jose Menendez threatened to kill them. The brothers claim that they shot their parents in self-defense because they believed Jose would have killed them if they jeopardized his image. </p>

</div>

<p>The following uses the Menendez murders as the thematic topic of discussion in digital storytelling. Here, I will be contrasting and comparing <b>3 different forms of a digital story,</b> primarily focusing on the <b>elements of digital storytelling</b> and what makes a story successful. But first, what is a digital story?</p>

<hr> 

<div align="center">
<h2><i>Storytelling ... but make it digital ...</i></h2>
</div>

<br>

<p>A digital story is simply a story that utilizes digital technology. For example, videos, movies, images, tweets, augmented reality, virtual reality, video games, music, GIFs, and memes. This blog in itself is a digital story! A digital story has no strict format, but it must include any visual and sensory elements.</p>
<br>
<p>What makes digital storytelling special? Our brains are evolutionarily primed to receive and process information in the form of a story; this dates back to our ancestors, who traded knowledge and cautionary tales through verbal stories. Nowadays, the digital world is where we spend most of our time, and as the world changes, the way we tell stories must adapt as well. Digital stories are useful because they can travel worldwide and reach vast audiences since content can be viewed on any screen or digital display. Moreover, they can include various elements that enhance a story, such as background music, select images, videos, characters, etc., to create a full-sensory, emotional experience. Utilizing digital media adds another layer of passion and sentiment to a story.</p>

<hr>

<div align="center">
<h2><i>Interactive Slideshows</i></h2>
</div>

<br>

<p>However, the use of digital elements for storytelling must be approached with balance to be effective. The first digital story I will be examining is titled ‘The Menendez Brothers’<a href="https://prezi.com/p/w4nux_gebzwq/the-menendez-brothers/" target="_blank">[4]</a>, an interactive presentation created by McKenzie Martell on Prezi. Martell’s project covers the premise of the murders. Outlining who the Menendez family was, their aristocratic lifestyle, the crimes, and the psychological implications leading to the fatal ending. 

<p>This article from Cultural Detour<a href="https://www.culturaldetour.eu/en/learn/articles/2023083015560070/10-dos-and-don-ts-of-digital-storytelling-in-cultural-heritage/" target="_blank">[5]</a> outlines 10 do's and don'ts of digital storytelling in cultural heritage. They encourage storytellers to <u>be specific</u>, <u>be evocative</u>, <u>be specific</u>, and to <u>know your target audience.</u></p>

<p>This project does justice in getting the very basic facts of this story down. However, it is disingenuous as the aesthetic elements do not reflect the weight and realness of this story. On the first slide, we are met with a very blue and basic title page. The image used for the title is a silhouette of a head with gears in place of the brain (Fig. 2.1), signifying that there are ideas, perspectives, and critical thinking being done. This is a very generic template offered by Prezi that could have been adjusted to portray a correlation to the Menendez case, such as a picture of the family or the brothers alone. Additionally, the content of the Prezi is a summary of stated facts; no opinion or personal input is being shown; therefore, the image of the working gears is unrelated.</p>

<div align="center">
  
![Prezi Template](fig2.1)

*<b>Fig 2.1.</b>'My Mind Animated' Prezi Template [6].*

</div> 

<p>One of the first things that troubled me about this interactive presentation is that the motion of zooming in and out repeatedly is quite exasperating and confusing. Not all, but some of the slides zoom back out to the main title page before transitioning to the next piece of information. Repeating this causes inconsistency and distraction, as it seems that the viewer is reading about one topic but is taken back to the very beginning when they want to click next and keep reading. </p>

<p>Using transitions for a digital story is effective in enhancing visual appeal, making presentations engaging, bringing content to life, and maintaining consistency. Transitions are used to indicate change and progress within a story or presentation and are effective in shifting the viewer’s mindset. This Prezi does well in applying the same transition style to keep uniformity and professionalism. However, it lacks a logical flow of information. On the other hand, for some viewers, this can be seen as a helpful indicator of new information approaching. Transitions can establish a sense of a new beginning, letting the audience maintain engagement and prepare for what is upcoming.</p>

<p>Many aspects of this digital story are successful in the idea of consistency; however, consistency is not always compelling. In the discussion of word font, it is wise to apply the same font(s) throughout a piece to create a sense of order and organization, especially in a visual presentation. Using various fonts is encouraged to determine the tone and readability of a story. Martell’s Prezi uses the same bold, narrow, capitalized font for titles, dates, and bodies of text throughout the entire presentation. It is always best to utilize different, readable fonts to create a distinction between the title, heading, and text. This “small” detail immensely affects the perceived tone of a story. In this case, the font suggests the feeling of a rushed and congested story. </p>

<p>This visually unappealing design choice makes it difficult to read and comprehend information as it blends the entirety of the text. If this slideshow were to be presented in a classroom, it would be extremely difficult for readers in the back rows. Font choice goes a long way in creating the atmosphere of a presentation. <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-font-presentation-73096.html" target="_blank"> [7] </a> </p>

<br>

<div align="center">
  
!["I will always find you" in two different fonts](fig2.2)

*<b>Fig 2.2.</b>Why Fonts Matter. [8]).*

</div> 

<p>Additionally, the quantity of text in certain slides adds to the predicament of reading this story. From my experience with Prezi, the section bubbles can help organize text. However, Prezi allows the creator to have control over the negative space around section bubbles as well. This project fails to exercise artistic elements of design as it strictly uses one of the templates Prezi presents and remains within the parameters it gives you. This led to their text being small, squished together, and/or “spilling” outside the section bubble. A readable alternative would have been to separate the body into smaller sections. </p>

<p>Lastly, still concerning utilizing negative, or white space<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designer-secrets-3-tips-using-white-space-your-presentation-funce/" target="_blank"> [9]</a> (Fig. 2.3), the images Martell used in the story are fairly small, making it difficult to view even on a close-up computer screen. Strategically placing photos in pieces is extremely effective in creating digital stories, as it allows audiences to visualize your story. In this case, Martell uses images of the Menendez family to give a face to the information. However, it seems more likely that the pictures are stuck there as a simple space filler or evidence.</p>

<div align="center">
  
!['White Space in Graphic Design' Infographic](fig2.3)

*<b>Fig 2.3.</b>White Space in Graphic Design. [10].*

</div> 

<p>There is much potential here, as more emotion could be evoked from viewers if the images were larger and corresponded to the information being focused on. For example, Martell could have given descriptions underneath the photos to describe what was going on or who was depicted. This would help in the distinction of Lyle and Erik.</p>

<p>Creative design elements such as this demonstrate another “small” detail that impacts the atmosphere of the story. To create a more picturesque impression, the images used by Martell could be rearranged and resized to generate balance and correlation between text and visuals (for example, descriptions underneath the photos to describe what was going on or who was depicted, which would help in the distinction between Lyle and Erik). Additionally, this allows the reader to take a visual break. </p>

<h2><i>Moving Pictures</i></h2>
</div>

<br>

<p>Speaking of, let’s take a break from reading digital stories and examine the most efficient format of digital storytelling, videos. Researchers have concluded that the human brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text <a href="https://www.oneday.com/blog/why-video-is-more-powerful-than-text#:~:text=Text%20Loses%20the%20Video%20vs.&text=To%20that%20point%2C%20researchers%20have,it%20far%20faster%20than%20text." target="_blank">[11]</a> Telling stories through 'moving pictures’ engages all senses—your eyes, mind, and heart. This creates a powerful and immersive story that is incredibly effective in driving engagement; this is why video storytelling is an effective marketing tactic that businesses use to reach their consumers. </p>

<br>

[![Click here to watch "Brothers Confess to Murdering Parents -- But Are They Innocent? (The Menendez Brothers" by 'The Inforgraphic Show' on YouTube [12]](infographicshow.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pffa1JO-RDs)

<br>

<p>The video in question is one done by‘The Infographic Show’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheInfographicsShow" target="_blank">[13]</a> on YouTube, titled Brothers Confess to Murdering Parents—But Are They Innocent? (The Menendez Brothers)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pffa1JO-RDs" target="_blank">[12]. This visual explanation of the Menendez murders is 11 minutes and 40 seconds long, which is enticing to audiences, such as myself, who have a shorter attention span and/or who simply want to understand the gist without reading about it. Marketing research<a href="https://wistia.com/learn/marketing/optimal-video-length" target="_blank"> [14]</a>shows that the shorter a video is, the stronger it is at driving engagement (Fig. 3.1). Additionally, the digital elements behind a video, movie, documentary, ad, etc. that make videos captivating include camera angles, soundtracks, characters, color, and such things that appeal to our visual and auditory senses. 
</p>
<br>

<div align="center">
  
![Average Engagement vs. Video Length data chart](fig3.1)

*<b>Fig 3.1.</b>Average Engagement vs. Video Length.[14]).*

</div> 

<p>As mentioned further in this project, individuals with impairments and/or disabilities might find a digital video story either helpful or unhelpful. Although a short video like this is great for a quick rundown of the premise of the story, it may be too fast-paced for people, like me, with auditory processing disorders<a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/auditory-processing-disorder" target="_blank">[15]</a> who find it difficult to retain swift information. Luckily, most platforms like YouTube provide closed captioning and transcripts of the audio so that individuals who wish can watch the video and follow along with the words. It is also essential to productive digital storytelling that designers consider a variety of audiences and accessibility.</p>

<p>Another digital element I found effective was the use of a human voice for narration. A few videos, especially instructional videos, are recorded using AI-generated voices. Similar to the type of voice we hear from Google Home, Alexa, or Siri. Although using an AI voice would be quicker and would potentially cost less money, the choice of recording with a real person is imperative to the engagement and connection with the audience. Since a human is processing and relaying information to the viewers, they have the power to add emphasis and modify the tone of the video. It is easier for a viewer to relate and remain interested in the video if it seems like someone is simply entertaining them by telling a story. </p>

<p>Additionally, by using a strong, unique voice such as this narrator, viewers will be able to identify and create an association with ‘The Infographic Show’. Watchers may hear the audio of a video and think, “Hey! I know that voice. That’s ‘The Infographic Show’.”</p>

<p> This channel succeeds in creating a fast-paced explanation of the Menendez murders using isometric digital art<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/isometric-art.html#:~:text=Isometric%20art%20is%20a%20drawing,illusion%20of%20a%203D%20perspective." target="_blank">[16]</a> to create a visual narrative of the case. The use of such a generic art style (Fig. 3.2 and 3.3) is effective in simply indicating the characters, roles, settings, and relationships revolving around this story. </p>

<br> 
<div align="center">

*<b>Fig 3.1.</b>Futuristic and Material Isometric Illustrations. [17]).*

</div> 

<br>
<p>On the contrasting side, these infographic-style cartoons have a limit to how much detail and accuracy can be conveyed. For example, in this screenshot (Fig.3.4), with the help of subtitles, we know we are in the midst of the Menendez brothers committing their second killing. The cartoon figures are always shown with smiling faces because of the art style that prevents the demonstration of accurate emotions the brothers and their mother would have been experiencing, like horror, shock, and menace. </p>

<br> 

<div align="center">

*<b>Fig 3.4.</b>Brothers Confess to Murdering Parents - But Are They Innocent? (The Menendez Brothers) by The Infographic Show.(minute 3:06s) [12] ).*

</div> 

<br> 
<p>This design choice becomes problematic when narrating a story with a topic of such weight and severity. Although these characters are meant to simply represent a role, they are misleading and can create an atmosphere of lightheartedness, which is not an accurate representation of the real story at hand. However, the genericness of each character can prevent certain biases because aspects such as ethnicity and sexuality cannot be assumed, and, therefore, preconceived notions are avoided. Effective digital storytelling calls for finding the balance between too much and not enough detail.</p>

<p>Similarly, another element, ‘The Infographic Show,’ utilizes, is adding speech and thought bubbles to their characters. This is effective in the same way as highlighting or bolding a particular word in a text can indicate its importance. Speech bubbles are signals of a significant conversation between people or provide the audience with a general idea of what was said. However, this too can harm the semblance of this case. This screenshot (Fig. 3.5) depicts a young Menendez brother playing at the park. The speech bubble says, “Does your dad hit you all the time, too?” This extremely childish depiction of a child blatantly expressing concerns about domestic abuse is satirically inaccurate to the real trauma the brothers endured as children. While this digital element is effective in adding context to images, it might be utilized better to reflect a more probable scenario. </p>

<h2><i>Back to Basics</i></h2>
</div>

<p>My favored method of storytelling is an article, a book, a map, a memoir, or any means of literature. Therefore, in my biased opinion, this online article from <i>People’s Magazine</i><a  href="https://people.com/who-were-jose-kitty-menendez-brothers-parents-8713203" target="_blank">[19]</a> is presented in the most effective form of a digital story overall, and, in comparison to the other two. Contrasting to the digital story above, this piece provides a further developed summary of the Menendez murders by providing insights into who Jose and Kitty Menendez were. An article like this is successful because it follows the applicable 7 elements of digital storytelling as developed and promulgated by The Center for Digital Storytelling (CDS) <a href="https://www.storycenter.org/" target="_blank">[20]</a> in Berkeley, California. (Fig. 4.1)</p>

<div align="center">

</div> 

<br>

<p>Personally, I prefer fictional horror stories, and I hardly find myself being entertained by true crimes. However, this case has intrigued me since I came across it some years ago. Thanks to the newest installment of Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan’s newest installment of “Monster” anthology on Netflix,<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/monster-season-2-the-lyle-and-erik-menendez-story" target="_blank">[21]</a> the Menendez murder story has reclaimed its spotlight for 'murderinos’<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=murderinos" target="_blank">[22]</a> everywhere and instantly gave me inspiration for this assignment. Further, I wasn’t patient enough to finish the series, so I googled my queries, such as who exactly were José and Kitty Menendez? This inquiry is the ‘dramatic question’ to which <b>#1 and #2</b> on the elements list refer, the “key question that keeps the viewer’s attention and will be answered by the end of the story.” Epistemic curiosity leads us to endless questioning, such as why or how the Menendez parents became so corrupt, what kind of business José was in, and what specifically their mother did to inflict her fate. </p>

)

<br>

<p>	The digital element that is most effective in this format is the use of hyperlinks <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_are_hyperlinks" target="_blank">[23]</a> to aid in citing sources and promoting additional readings in a visually pleasing manner. Hyperlinks are ubiquitous in this article, which creates engagement for individuals who want to investigate on their own.<b>#6</b> encourages digital story creators to refrain from overloading the viewers with too much content. As discussed earlier, too much text can be overwhelming and possibly unreadable to some viewers. The usage of hyperlinks helps the writer save space, stay organized, and allows the audience to fall into an investigative rabbit hole on their own. In doing so, this article employs <b>#4 </b>, which essentially encourages digital storytellers to personalize their writing to reach out to various readers. </p>

<p>Another key digital element utilized and used more effectively here is the use of images. Our brains cannot evolve fast enough to comprehend the plethora of information being dumped on us daily, and so contemporary society relies on visuals. This article provides clear, enlarged images of the Menendez family with image captions and sources. This outwardly establishes who is being captured as well as the fact that it is from a credible source. Images have the power to evoke strong emotion and connection, making them a perfect tool to make a digital story memorable and personal (<b>#3</b>). </p>

<div align="center">
  
![Lyle and Erik Menendez; Jose and Kitty Menendez](fig4.2)

*<b>Fig 4.2.</b> Lyle and Erik Menendez; Jose and Kitty Menendez. Photo: AP Photo/Nick Ut. [24]).*

</div> 

<br>

<p>	I find the pictures of the Menendez family used in this article to be compelling (Fig.4.2), as they are completely contrasting. The images of the nefarious Jose and Kitty are smiling, and the murderous victims are seen as stern and/or scared. Emotionally charged images can stir souls and generate connections that overstep language barriers; they are the universal language and can be interpreted in a myriad of ways, deeming images a valuable method of global communication. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/power-visual-storytelling-why-image-speaks-100-times-stronger-emam/" target="_blank">[25]</a> </p>

<p>Lastly, this article is successful in keeping the pace (<b>#7</b>) of the story flowing. Another method of giving the reader a visual break is through the use of photos that weave throughout sections of text. Author Jessica Sager maintains the reader’s attention span by spacing out written information and replacing white space with images. This has been successful in boosting engagement by lightening the load on the reader's brain. <a href="https://www.imgix.com/blog/beyond-words-the-power-of-images-in-digital storytelling#:~:text=Weaving%20images%20throughout%20your%20content,message%20and%20appreciate%20your%20story." target="_blank">[26]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, readers with visual impairments and/or disabilities could find this method of digital storytelling nearly or entirely impossible. For example, my personal experience with ADD leaves me finding certain lengthy texts problematic, as my attention span is quite slender. Oddly enough, reading text is my favorite method of digital storytelling because I can understand information at my own  speed. Whereas other people with the same or varying disabilities find videos to be more favorable towards their attention span and grasp of the story. A suggestion for inclusivity would be to include the option to provide an audio recording of the text for individuals to play, listen to, and/or read along with the text. <a href="https://niemanreports.org/audio-articles-are-helping-news-outlets-gain-loyal-audiences/" target="_blank">[27]</a></p>
