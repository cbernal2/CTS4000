<p>On the evening of August 20th, 1989, brothers <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menendez-brothers-inside-the-notorious-case-48-hours/" target="_blank">Lyle and Erik Menendez shot their parents</a>, Jose and Kitty Mendez (Fig. 1.1), and killed them in their own home in Beverly Hills, California. After burying their shotguns, they visited their local movie theater to see the latest Batman movie, creating an alibi. Upon returning to their home, Lyle called 911 and claimed, “Somebody killed my parents!”. Questioning the children of the victims is hardly a first thought, especially if they were the ones who made the call. Initially, the police suspected that the murders were mafia-related, as Jose was a significant businessman with ties. At this point, Lyle and Erik had pulled off a smooth and successful murder.

<p>What makes this case of domestic homicide especially intriguing is that eventually, both murderers openly admitted to their crimes. But why? After a month-long testimony, the brothers intensely described the years of sexual abuse they endured from their parents. When the brothers stood up and threatened to expose what was happening to them, Jose Menendez threatened to kill them. The brothers claim that they shot their parents in self-defense because they believed Jose would have killed them if they jeopardized his image. </p>

<p>The following uses the Menendez murders as the thematic topic of discussion in digital storytelling. Here, I will be contrasting and comparing <b>3 different forms of a digital story,</b> primarily focusing on the <b>elements of digital storytelling</b> and what makes a story successful. But first, what is a digital story?</p>

<hr> 

<div align="center">
<h2><i>Storytelling ... but make it digital ...</i></h2>
</div>

<br>

<p>A digital story is simply a story that utilizes digital technology. For example, videos, movies, images, tweets, augmented reality, virtual reality, video games, music, GIFs, and memes. This blog in itself is a digital story! A digital story has no strict format, but it must include any visual and sensory elements.</p>
<br>
<p>What makes digital storytelling special? Our brains are evolutionarily primed to receive and process information in the form of a story; this dates back to our ancestors, who traded knowledge and cautionary tales through verbal stories. Nowadays, the digital world is where we spend most of our time, and as the world changes, the way we tell stories must adapt as well. Digital stories are useful because they can travel worldwide and reach vast audiences since content can be viewed on any screen or digital display. Moreover, they can include various elements that enhance a story, such as background music, select images, videos, characters, etc., to create a full-sensory, emotional experience. Utilizing digital media adds another layer of passion and sentiment to a story.</p>

<h2><i>Interactive Slideshows</i></h2>
</div>

<br>

<p>However, the use of digital elements for storytelling must be approached with balance to be effective. The first digital story I will be examining is titled <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w4nux_gebzwq/the-menendez-brothers/" target="_blank">‘The Menendez Brothers’</a>, an interactive presentation created by McKenzie Martell on Prezi. Martell’s project covers the premise of the murders. Outlining who the Menendez family was, their aristocratic lifestyle, the crimes, and the psychological implications leading to the fatal ending. 

<p>This article from <a href="https://www.culturaldetour.eu/en/learn/articles/2023083015560070/10-dos-and-don-ts-of-digital-storytelling-in-cultural-heritage/" target="_blank">Cultural Detour</a> outlines 10 do's and don'ts of digital storytelling in cultural heritage. They encourage storytellers to <u>be specific</u>, <u>be evocative</u>, <u>be specific</u>, and to <u>know your target audience.</u></p>

<p>This project does justice in getting the very basic facts of this story down. However, it is disingenuous as the aesthetic elements do not reflect the weight and realness of this story. On the first slide, we are met with a very blue and basic title page. The image used for the title is a silhouette of a head with gears in place of the brain (Fig. 2.1), signifying that there are ideas, perspectives, and critical thinking being done. This is a very generic template offered by Prezi that could have been adjusted to portray a correlation to the Menendez case, such as a picture of the family or the brothers alone. Additionally, the content of the Prezi is a summary of stated facts; no opinion or personal input is being shown; therefore, the image of the working gears is unrelated.</p>

<div align="center">

</div> 

<p>One of the first things that troubled me about this interactive presentation is that the motion of zooming in and out repeatedly is quite exasperating and confusing. Not all, but some of the slides zoom back out to the main title page before transitioning to the next piece of information. Repeating this causes inconsistency and distraction, as it seems that the viewer is reading about one topic but is taken back to the very beginning when they want to click next and keep reading. </p>

<p>Using transitions for a digital story is effective in enhancing visual appeal, making presentations engaging, bringing content to life, and maintaining consistency. Transitions are used to indicate change and progress within a story or presentation and are effective in shifting the viewer’s mindset. This Prezi does well in applying the same transition style to keep uniformity and professionalism. However, it lacks a logical flow of information. On the other hand, for some viewers, this can be seen as a helpful indicator of new information approaching. Transitions can establish a sense of a new beginning, letting the audience maintain engagement and prepare for what is upcoming.</p>

<p>Many aspects of this digital story are successful in the idea of consistency; however, consistency is not always compelling. In the discussion of word font, it is wise to apply the same font(s) throughout a piece to create a sense of order and organization, especially in a visual presentation. Using various fonts is encouraged to determine the tone and readability of a story. Martell’s Prezi uses the same bold, narrow, capitalized font for titles, dates, and bodies of text throughout the entire presentation. It is always best to utilize different, readable fonts to create a distinction between the title, heading, and text. This “small” detail immensely affects the perceived tone of a story. In this case, the font suggests the feeling of a rushed and congested story. </p>

<p>This visually unappealing design choice makes it difficult to read and comprehend information as it blends the entirety of the text. If this slideshow were to be presented in a classroom, it would be extremely difficult for readers in the back rows.<a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-font-presentation-73096.html" target="_blank"> Font choice goes a long way in creating the atmosphere of a presentation.</a> </p>

<br>

<div align="center">

</div> 

<p>Additionally, the quantity of text in certain slides adds to the predicament of reading this story. From my experience with Prezi, the section bubbles can help organize text. However, Prezi allows the creator to have control over the negative space around section bubbles as well. This project fails to exercise artistic elements of design as it strictly uses one of the templates Prezi presents and remains within the parameters it gives you. This led to their text being small, squished together, and/or “spilling” outside the section bubble. A readable alternative would have been to separate the body into smaller sections. </p>

<p>Lastly, still concerning utilizing negative, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designer-secrets-3-tips-using-white-space-your-presentation-funce/" target="_blank">white space</a> (Fig. 2.3), the images Martell used in the story are fairly small, making it difficult to view even on a close-up computer screen. Strategically placing photos in pieces is extremely effective in creating digital stories, as it allows audiences to visualize your story. In this case, Martell uses images of the Menendez family to give a face to the information. However, it seems more likely that the pictures are stuck there as a simple space filler or evidence.</p>

</div> 

<p>There is much potential here, as more emotion could be evoked from viewers if the images were larger and corresponded to the information being focused on. For example, Martell could have given descriptions underneath the photos to describe what was going on or who was depicted. This would help in the distinction of Lyle and Erik.</p>

<p>Creative design elements such as this demonstrate another “small” detail that impacts the atmosphere of the story. To create a more picturesque impression, the images used by Martell could be rearranged and resized to generate balance and correlation between text and visuals (for example, descriptions underneath the photos to describe what was going on or who was depicted, which would help in the distinction between Lyle and Erik). Additionally, this allows the reader to take a visual break. </p>

<p>Speaking of, let’s take a break from reading digital stories and examine the most efficient format of digital storytelling, videos. Researchers have concluded that <a href="https://www.oneday.com/blog/why-video-is-more-powerful-than-text#:~:text=Text%20Loses%20the%20Video%20vs.&text=To%20that%20point%2C%20researchers%20have,it%20far%20faster%20than%20text." target="_blank">the human brain processes visuals 60,000</a> times faster than text. Telling stories through 'moving pictures’ engages all senses—your eyes, mind, and heart. This creates a powerful and immersive story that is incredibly effective in driving engagement; this is why video storytelling is an effective marketing tactic that businesses use to reach their consumers. </p>
