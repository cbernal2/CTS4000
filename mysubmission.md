  On the evening of August 20th, 1989, brothers <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menendez-brothers-inside-the-notorious-case-48-hours/" target="blank_">Lyle and Erik Menendez shot their parents</a>, Jose and Kitty Mendez (Fig. 1.1), and killed them in their own home in Beverly Hills, California. After burying their shotguns, they visited their local movie theater to see the latest Batman movie, creating an alibi. Upon returning to their home, Lyle called 911 and claimed, “Somebody killed my parents!”. Questioning the children of the victims is hardly a first thought, especially if they were the ones who made the call. Initially, the police suspected that the murders were mafia-related, as Jose was a significant businessman with ties. At this point, Lyle and Erik had pulled off a smooth and successful murder.
